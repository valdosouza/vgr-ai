# 🔧 HarnessKit

![HarnessKit - 5-Step Engineering Cycle](docs/assets/harness-cycle-banner.png)

> **Harness Engineering**: A reliable AI agent is not just a raw model. It is defined as:
> $$\text{Reliable Agent} = \text{Model (AI)} + \text{Harness (Controls)} + \text{Human Auditor}$$

HarnessKit is a complete AI-assisted software engineering methodology built on **Harness Engineering**—the principle that true reliability comes from enclosing generative models inside structured execution scaffolds and human-driven governance loops.

## 👑 The Core Engine: Autonomous Orchestration & Live Auditing

At the heart of HarnessKit is the **`autonomous-orchestrator`** skill. Once provided with the initial task scope, it runs an atomic, continuous execution cycle without stopping, pausing, or asking redundant questions—fully automating domain planning, TDD execution, and multi-agent code reviews.

**However, the human engineer is never replaced: your role evolves into Live Auditing.**

While the orchestrator executes continuously, you act as the **Human Auditor** in the cockpit, tracking the live stream through your coding workspace (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, Copilot, etc.). The AI moves with sovereignty, but you maintain continuous telemetry and oversight.

### ⚡ Hot-Interception: Absolute Human Command

Because the engine runs seamlessly without waiting for permissions at every step, you use this live observability to dynamically intercept the loop when necessary:

* **Pull the Emergency Brake:** Forcefully kill the execution (`Ctrl+C`) the moment you notice the AI has adopted an incorrect architectural premise.
* **Live In-Flight Injections:** Hot-patch the active backlog, append newly uncovered constraints, or update domain specifications while the loop is running.
* **Dynamic Parameter Tweaking:** Modify configuration thresholds on the fly—lower the validation score target (default **0.70**) to accept a minor style debt, or increase `maxReworks` directly inside the configuration files.

### 🔍 Socratic Code Review in Action

To prevent systemic risks (such as N+1 queries, memory leaks, security vulnerabilities, or database connection exhaustion), HarnessKit employs a **Socratic Code Review** model. The orchestrator invokes the **`the-grumpy-tech-lead`** to validate the code inferentially by asking deep architectural questions rather than providing copy-paste solutions.

Below is a visual example of how this interactive code review occurs under your watch:

![Socratic Code Review Example](docs/assets/code-review.png)

### 🤖 Autonomous State Machine

The loop is driven by a robust **Product State Machine**. It tracks feature backlogs and dynamic transition gates, ensuring that a feature only progresses when quality criteria are fully satisfied.

![Autonomous State Machine](docs/assets/update-state-machine.png)

Based on gate scores, the orchestrator updates the project state machine into four terminal statuses:

* **`COMPLETED`**: Approved and ready for your final PR review.
* **`RETRY`**: Scores fell short; the engine compiles a `REWORK-LOG.md` and loops back to code automatically.
* **`BLOCKED`**: Critical crash/break—the engine triggers a circuit breaker and halts for immediate human intervention.
* **`FAILED`**: Non-blocking tech debt—the pipeline logs the issue and moves to the next feature, leaving the debt for you to audit later.

## What's Inside

To prevent role contamination, the orchestrator isolates operational contexts by dispatching highly specialized agent personas equipped with dedicated skills.

### 🛠️ Skills (`/skills`)

| Skill | Core Function |
| --- | --- |
| **Project Memory** (`project-memory`) | Generates and maintains persistent technical documentation (`docs/README.md`, `docs/adr/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/adr/TESTS.md`). The agent's long-term memory. |
| **Scope Refinement** (`scope-refinement`) | DDD-based scope orchestrator. Maps Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, and Use Cases. Produces test scenarios before implementation starts. |
| **Autonomous Orchestrator** (`autonomous-orchestrator`) | Sovereign loop manager. Fully automates execution across planning, implementation, validation, and auto-tuning phases without user interruption. |
| **TDD Orchestrator** (`tdd-orchestrator`) | Enforces RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. Coordinates the full test-driven development cycle, blocking implementation without a failing test first. |
| **The Grumpy Tech Lead** (`the-grumpy-tech-lead`) | Senior technical reviewer. Uses Socratic questioning to expose systemic risks (N+1, leaks, race conditions, SOLID violations). |
| **Harness Tracer** (`harness-tracer`) | Records structured execution traces after each session to `docs/harness-history/traces/`. Raw material for harness optimization. |
| **Harness Evaluator** (`harness-evaluator`) | Aggregates traces, computes composite scores per skill chain, and updates the Pareto frontier of best harness configurations. |
| **Meta-Harness** (`meta-harness`) | Proposer for the harness optimization loop. Reads history, diagnoses failure patterns, and proposes targeted SKILL.md improvements. |

### 🤖 Expert Agents (`./agents`)

| Agent | Role | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Software Architect](agents/software-architect.md)** | System Design & Refinement | DDD modeling, architectural decisions, and implementation planning. |
| **[Harness Tech Lead](agents/harness-tech-lead.md)** | Automated Code Review | Evaluates systemic risks, scalability, security, and design patterns. |
| **[Developer Backend](agents/developer-backend.md)** | Backend Engineering | Robust APIs, database modeling, and server-side logic with TDD. |
| **[Developer Frontend](agents/developer-frontend.md)** | Frontend Engineering | UI/UX implementation, accessibility, and client-side performance with TDD. |
| **[Developer Debugging](agents/developer-debugging.md)** | Root Cause Specialist | Systematic bug investigation using the "5 Whys" methodology. |
| **[QA Engineer](agents/harness-qa.md)** | Quality Assurance | E2E testing strategy, automation, security validation, and adversarial QA testing. |
| **[Meta-Harness Agent](agents/meta-harness-agent.md)** | Harness Optimizer | Reads harness history filesystem, diagnoses failure patterns, proposes targeted skill improvements. |

## Project Documentation Setup

The `docs/` folder acts as HarnessKit's **persistent memory** for your project. It centralizes the technical knowledge that allows agents to operate autonomously and accurately across sessions.

### Required files

| File | Function |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/README.md` | Summary and index. The agent's main map for navigating your project. |
| `docs/adr/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architecture rules. Prevents design decisions inconsistent with the project. |
| `docs/adr/TESTS.md` | Quality protocol. Defines the testing framework and standards. |

> **Tip:** Use `project-memory` to generate these automatically before running the orchestrator:
> `/harness-kit:project-memory`

## Harness Optimization Loop

The toolkit isn't rigid—it learns and evolves based on real execution telemetry saved right into your repository:

```text
Sessions (real work)
       ↓
 meta-harness-agent    ← always runs harness-tracer (every session)
       ↓
 harness-evaluator     ← auto-triggered when trace count is a multiple of 5
       ↓
 meta-harness          ← only on explicit user request
       ↓
 Human review & approval (Live Auditing)
       ↓
 Apply candidate → collect sessions → evaluate → promote or discard
       ↓
 Loop repeats

```

**How to start optimization manually:**

```bash
# After ≥3 sessions have been recorded by harness-tracer:
/harness-kit:harness-evaluator

# After reviewing pareto-frontier.md:
/harness-kit:meta-harness

# After applying the candidate and collecting sessions:
/harness-kit:harness-evaluator
/harness-kit:meta-harness --promote v001

```

## Philosophy

* **Harness Engineering** — Reliability comes from controls, not just capability. An agent without a harness is unpredictable.
* **Test-Driven Development** — Write tests first. Always. No exceptions.
* **Domain-Driven Design** — Model the problem before solving it.
* **Socratic over Prescriptive** — The Grumpy Tech Lead asks questions that force the engineer to think, rather than providing ready-made answers.
* **Computational + Inferential** — Tests validate correctness. Reviews validate judgment.
