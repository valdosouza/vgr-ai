      `3. Read \`${backlogFile}\` to identify the specification \`Domain\`. Use it to place/locate the feature doc at \`${specsPattern}\`.`,
      `4. If an existing document already covers this feature's changes, fixes, updates or improvements, update that file. Otherwise, create a new one.`,

      `- The \`FOLDER STRUCTURE\` section must reflect the module's current relevant structure, adding this cycle's paths without dropping paths from prior cycles.`,

      `## Prohibited`,
      `- NEVER include TDD/validation/score details in feature docs — those belong in DECISIONS.md only.`,
      `- NEVER add narrative explanations, justifications, or process history. \`TODO\`-style notes for future implementation are the only exception, and only in specification or decision files.`,
